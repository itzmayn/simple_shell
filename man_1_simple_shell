This is a brief description of a C-based UNIX command interpreter, which functions as a clone of the "sh" command interpreter. It performs the following tasks:

    Executes commands obtained from the standard input.
    Provides the status of the most recently executed command, returning 0 if no command was executed. Numeric values indicate exit failure codes.
    Utilizes the PATH environment variable to locate executable program files.
    Can be invoked interactively or non-interactively.
    When invoked without a terminal connected to the standard input, it reads and executes commands in the received order.
    When invoked with a terminal connected to the standard input, it opens an interactive shell.
    Displays the prompt "($)" to indicate readiness for command input.
    Command options are specified after the main command, preceded by a space and a '-' symbol.
    For example: "./hsh [command] [options]"
